Due to some unforeseen circumstances, we've had to move both of the presentations to be held remotely.

But you're still welcome to come and attend the meetup and watch the presentations with us, eat some pizza and meet like minded people.

And a kind reminder to update your RSVP if you have changed your mind or can no long attend our meetup, so we know how much food and drinks to get.
